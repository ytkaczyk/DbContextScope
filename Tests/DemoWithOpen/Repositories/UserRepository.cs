   * An example "repository" relying on an ambient DbContext instance.
   * 
   * Since we use EF to persist our data, the actual repository is of course the EF DbContext. This
   * class is called a "repository" for old time's sake but is merely just a collection 
   * of pre-built Linq-to-Entities queries. This avoids having these queries copied and 
   * pasted in every service method that need them and facilitates unit testing. 
   * 
   * Whether your application would benefit from using this additional layer or would
   * be better off if its service methods queried the DbContext directly or used some sort of query 
   * object pattern is a design decision for you to make.
   * 
   * DbContextScope is agnostic to this and will happily let you use any approach you
   * deem most suitable for your application.
